# ECEApp - Early Childhood Education App

This Project involves the development and implementation of an information system for managing the certification and curriculum documents for the Preschool Center facilities in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
It is an Android-based App.

The Early Childhood Education Documentation Application is the ideal way to store and access information that is vital to your early childhood education facility.  
The application provides a centralized solution for everything from student lists, medical information, and emergency contact information for students, teacher resources and manuals, and more. To access the application and its features, follow the below instructions for installation.

The App was developed using Android Studio (JAVA). We had about three months to develop this solution and, since we had to study Android Studio and AWS, we didn't want risk too much so we decided to "play safe" with JAVA as programming language.

Our App was deployed by using F-Droid (https://www.f-droid.org/) at that time.
